# XProject

XProject, a project manager for XML technologies.

## What's it do?

XProject provides a command-line tool to manage a project using
XML-related technologies.  Based on simple directories conventions,
and annotations with the XML components, it builds automatically
EXPath packages for your project, as well as releases ZIP file, runs
unit tests or generate the documentation out of the sources.
